The performance of Quicksort varies greatly between using a fixed and a random pivot, particularly for larger lists. Fixed pivot Quicksort's times increase sharply, hinting at a move towards its worst-case scenario, especially evident at sizes 2000 and beyond. The random pivot method remains more consistent, better matching its average-case O(n log n) complexity. The choice of pivot thus significantly affects efficiency, with random pivots showing a clear advantage in maintaining expected performance across different list sizes. Changing the input type would likely magnify these differences, underscoring the impact of pivot selection on Quicksort's real-world speed.

It shows that the fastest of the second version is faster. It is 0.012 while the first one is 0.210. The fastest in the sorted() is also the random pivot while mine was the fixed pivot.
